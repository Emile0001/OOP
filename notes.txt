Pillars of object orientated programming (paradigm )

1. Encapsulation - group related property and methods
2. Abstraction - move some methods outside of object, simpler ui less impact on change
3. Inheritance - eliminate redundant code, generic object whereby other objects inherit methods from that generic object
4. Polymorphism - many forms, gets rid of switch and case instead: element.render();

old school programming: Procedural programming - decoupled
bunch of functions and variables that leads to spaghetti code, change one function then it breaks the other functions

objects

1.  object has more than one method - called behavior, object has behavior

Factory Function
1. creates a object

Constructor Function

1. creates function using this. and new
2. function name starts with a Capital
